Install package dev dependencies\n2. Create an output directory called \"dist\"\n3. Install \"concurrently\" & \"browser-sync\" globally\n4. Run our app in the browser\n\nYou'll find this \"setup\" script located in your *package.json*.\n\n> We'll be installing several NPM packages from terminal. You may consider installing a plugin for adding a terminal inside your editor, such as [\"platformio-ide-terminal\"](https://github.com/platformio/platformio-atom-ide-terminal).",

      "description": "An **action** is a named event that can trigger a change in your application data.\n\nActions are often broken into three parts to make your code more readable.\n\n##### 1. Actions\n\nAn **action** includes a named \"type\".\n```js\nconst action = { type: 'ACTION_NAME' };\n```\n\nActions may also include other possible params needed to transform that data.\n\n```js\nconst getItem = { type: 'GET_ITEM', clientId: 42, payload: { id: 12 } };\n```\n\nNormal params passed in are often put inside of a `payload` object. This is part of a standard called [Flux Standard Action](https://github.com/acdlite/flux-standard-action). Other common fields include `error` & `meta`.\n\n##### 2. Action Creators\n\nAn **action creator** is a functions that creates an action.\n\n```js\nconst actionName = () => ({ type: 'ACTION_NAME' });\n```\n\nAction creators make it easy to pass params into an action.\n\n```js\nconst getItem = (clientId, id) => ({ type: 'GET_ITEM', clientId: 42, payload: { id: 12 } });\n```\n\n##### 3. Action Types\n\nOften, the action name is also extracted as an **action type**. This is helpful for readability and to catch action name typos. Additionally, most editors will auto-complete your action types from the variable name.\n\n```js\nconst ACTION_NAME = 'ACTION_NAME';\nconst GET_ITEM = 'GET_ITEM';\n\nconst action = () => ({ type: ACTION_NAME });\nconst getItem = (id) => ({ type: GET_ITEM, payload: { id }});\n```\n\n> [Learn more](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/Actions.html).\n\nLet's write an action for voting up your choice of worst pokemon.",
